/**
 * ï»¿(Math: approximate the square root) There are several techniques for
 * implementing the sqrt method in the Math class. One such technique is known
 * as the Babylonian method. It approximates the square root of a number, n, by
 * repeatedly performing a calculation using the following formula:
 *
 * nextGuess = (lastGuess + n / lastGuess) / 2
 *
 * When nextGuess and lastGuess are almost identical, nextGuess is the
 * approximated square root. The initial guess can be any positive value (e.g.,
 * 1). This value will be the starting value for lastGuess. If the difference
 * between nextGuess and lastGuess is less than a very small number, such as
 * 0.0001, you can claim that nextGuess is the approximated square root of n. If
 * not, nextGuess becomes lastGuess and the approximation process continues.
 * Implement the following method that returns the square root of n.
