/*
(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula:

length = v^2 / 2a

Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway
length.

Here is a sample run:

Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286

Actual output:
Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.2857142857143
