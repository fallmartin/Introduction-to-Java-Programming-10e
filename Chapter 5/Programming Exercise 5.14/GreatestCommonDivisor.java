/**
 * ï»¿(Compute the greatest common divisor) Another solution for Listing 5.9 to
 * find the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows:
 * First find d to be the minimum of n1 and n2, then check whether d, d-1, d-2,
 * ..., 2, or 1 is a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. The first such
 * common divisor is the greatest common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program
 * that prompts the user to enter two positive integers and displays the gcd.
 *
 * Output:
 *
 * Enter two positive integers separated by a space: 56 74
 * The greatest common divisor of 56 and 74 is 2
