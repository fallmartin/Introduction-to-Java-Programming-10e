/**
 * ï»¿(Perfect number) A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is equal to
 * the sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is the first
 * perfect number because 6 = 3 + 2 + 1. The next is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2
 * + 1. There are four perfect numbers less than 10,000. Write a program to find all
 * these four numbers.
 *
 * Output:
 * 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
 * 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
 * 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248 = 496
 * 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 + 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064 = 8128
 * There are 4 perfect numbers less than 10,000.
