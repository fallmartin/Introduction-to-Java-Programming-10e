 * and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.
 * 
 * Enter current annual tuition cost: 10000
 * Enter the rate of annual cost increase (%): 5
 * Enter the expected years until university: 10
 * The tuition in ten years is $16,288.95
 * 
 * In 10 years, you'll need $16,288.95 for freshman year and $70,207.39 for 4 years.
