/**
 * ï»¿(Occurrence of max numbers) Write a program that reads integers, finds the
 * largest of them, and counts its occurrences. Assume that the input ends with
 * number 0. Suppose that you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program finds that the
 * largest is 5 and the occurrence count for 5 is 4. (Hint: Maintain two
 * variables, max and count. max stores the current max number, and count stores
 * its occurrences. Initially, assign the first number to max and 1 to count.
 * Compare each subsequent number with max. If the number is greater than max,
 * assign it to max and reset count to 1. If the number is equal to max,
 * increment count by 1.)
 * 
 * Output:
 * Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 0
The largest integer is 5 and it occurs 4 times.
