/**
 * ï»¿(Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
 * into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. So, the monthly
 * interest rate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the
 * account becomes 100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417 After the second month, the
 * value in the account becomes (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252 After
 * the third month, the value in the account becomes (100 + 201.252) * (1 +
 * 0.00417) = 302.507 and so on. Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * an amount (e.g., 100), the annual interest rate (e.g., 5), and the number of
 * months (e.g., 6) and displays the amount in the savings account after the
 * given month.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Enter enter an amount (e.g., 100): 100
Enter the annual interest rate (e.g., 5): 5
Enter the number of months (e.g., 6): 6
After 0 months, the value in the account becomes $100.42
After 1 month, the value in the account becomes $201.25
After 2 month, the value in the account becomes $302.51
After 3 month, the value in the account becomes $404.18
After 4 month, the value in the account becomes $506.28
After 5 month, the value in the account becomes $608.81
