 * (The Colorable interface) Design an interface named Colorable with a void

 * the Colorable interface. Design a class named Square that extends
 * GeometricObject and implements Colorable. Implement howToColor to
 * display the message Color all four sides.
 *
 * Draw a UML diagram that involves Colorable, Square, and GeometricObject.
 * Write a test program that creates an array of five GeometricObjects. For each
 * object in the array, display its area and invoke its howToColor method if it
 * is colorable.
